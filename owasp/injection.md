# OWASP \#1: Injection
Not going to talk much about the basics - injection is easy to understand. I'll focus more on fuzzing, polyglots, and technical implementations of defenses.
## SQLi
### The attack
Good polyglots:
`SLEEP(10) /*' or SLEEP(10) or'" or SLEEP(10) or "*/`
(works in single/double/direct contexts)
Useful tools:
- sqlmap
